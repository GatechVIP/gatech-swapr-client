				This experiment is the rotational equivalent of the "Motion with Constant Acceleration" experiment that we looked at in SC525 which involved a cart tied to a string that passed over a pulley and supported a vertical mass. In this experiment you will investigate moments of inertia by applying a torque to a disk that is free to rotate. The torque comes from a string wrapped around a pulley on the disk; the string passes over a second pulley and has a mass hanging from it.
