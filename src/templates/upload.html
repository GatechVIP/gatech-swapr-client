						This experiment is the rotational equivalent of the "Motion with Constant Acceleration" experiment that we looked at in SC525 which involved a cart tied to a string that passed over a pulley and supported a vertical mass. In this experiment you will investigate moments of inertia by applying a torque to a disk that is free to rotate. The torque comes from a string wrapped around a pulley on the disk; the string passes over a second pulley and has a mass hanging from it.

			<p>The moment of inertia I of a body is a measure of how hard it is to get it rotating about some axis. The moment I is to rotation as mass m is to translation. The larger the I, the more work required to get the object spinning, just as the larger the mass m, the more work required to get it moving in a straight line. Alloy rim wheels on bicycles have a lower I than steel rim wheels and so are easier to get spinning, making fast bicycle acceleration easier.

			The moment of inertia is always defined with reference to a particular axis of rotation â€” often a symmetry axis, but it can be any axis, even one that is outside the body. The moment of inertia of a body about a particular axis is defined as:</p>

				where the sum is over all parts of the body (labeled with an index i), mi is the mass of part i, and ri is the distance from part i to the axis of rotation. Performing this sum is easy if the body consists of discrete point masses. But if the body is a continuous object of some arbitrary shape, then performing the sum requires the techniques of integral calculus. In this course, we simply tell you the answer for various shapes. For a disk with an axis through the center of symmetry, the moment of inertia is
